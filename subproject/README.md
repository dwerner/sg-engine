# Dynamic loading of symbols from a subproject (game state)

# HINT try: 
- running the parent project
- making a change to ./src/lib.rs, (the body of use_state())
- then cargo build this subproject.

-On windows, at least, you should see your changes reflected at runtime-
this is now also fixed for linux!

Also, intellij supports this nested project with
File->New->Module from existing sources-> Select "subproject" dir and import
