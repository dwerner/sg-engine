# SG Engine (toy engine)

For now, this is just a toy engine, with many missing features, and breaks every 3 minutes.


### Demo

This project is intended to be my first stab at a complete game engine - but it is by no means complete yet. The main ideas around architecture are:

- Modular system design - allowing hot code loading
- composition over inheritance (but it's Rust so of course)

## What works:
- Module runtime reloading
- Vulkan rendering using [vulkano](https://github.com/tomaka/vulkano)
- Scene graph (Rc-based ADG) and push-constants 
- Loading obj models using [nom-obj](https://github.com/dwerner/nom-obj)
- Diffuse textures, UVW coordinates

## To do:
- Multiple textures
- Extremely inefficient shaders (per-vertex matrix operations, for no good reason)
- pretty much anything else... 

As I said, this is very much a work in progress, but I'd love input or PRs or criticism.

## My *opinionated architecture

*We all have our opinions. :)

## Hot loading

For any project that I work on, I like to move quickly and try ideas fast. I'm a monkey coder; I bash on this part and that until I get things to work. I don't want to wait for a full-compile cycle to try out a new idea... So a lot of my effort is spent in this library to optimize for that case. One way to do this is to reload sections of the program at runtime.

## `game_state`
 
The system is comprised of a base library for shared state, in addition to modules. `game_state` defines all shared, base types in the system, including the most global `State`, but also shared types and traits defining behavior and structure of input, ui, events, rendering, world entities, etc.

The `State` struct is central to the design, as it represents the state the game passes between each module. This allows each module, when not operating on the state, to be reloaded and the old state they are responsible for to be cleared. The actual loading of the modules is handled in the main project under `src/libloading`.

## Access traits

Several traits are defined and implemented on `State` to serve as a window of responsibility for common operations on the `State` object itself. This decouples the modules from any exact internal structure of `State`, but also allows common functionality to be shared between access traits. At a higher level, access traits to `State` serve as a way for a mod to state which aspects of `State` it really wants access to.

## Modules
 
Modules are compiled rust code, but are loaded at runtime and can be modified during the course of execution. When a new version is built, it will be picked up by `libloading` and loaded, while the old library will be unloaded.

In contrast, any changes to the `game_state` crate or it's dependencies (`nom-obj` - an .obj model parser, for instance) will need everything to be rebuilt that depends on it, otherwise strange things may happen, or worse.

### `mod_dummy`

This is a template mod, and is not built or linked, but rather serves as a starting point for creating a new mod.
 
### `mod_asset_loader`

A simple mod intended to load assets and prepare them for use by attaching them to the `State` object.

Access traits used: `RenderLayerAccess`

TODO:
- Expand on asset loading strategy

### `mod_input`

This module is responsible for coordinating and gathering input events in the internal format described in 
`game_state::input`.

Access traits used: `InputAccess`

TODO:
- Gather input from joysticks
- ...

### `mod_rendering_x`

Responsible for the implementation of renderers, adding the capacity for orthogonal changes to each renderer at runtime. Of course the renderers need to know how to clean themselves up in addition to initialize.

Renderer Status:

- VulkanRenderer - model and texture loading, needs work to expand asset pipeline support
- OpenGLRenderer - Stubbed, little more

Access Traits Used: 
- `RenderAccess`
- `RenderLayerAccess`

TODO:
- Implement OpenGL renderer so this can run on any machine supporting OpenGL
- Renderer specific, but lots of work needs to be done here, probably dependent on `mod_asset_loader` and expansion of access traits
- Software renderer

### `mod_simulation`

Simulation of the game world itself.

Access Traits Used: `SimulationAccess`

Todo:
- everything - this mod is just stubbed at this point
